Detailed Insights

    Work-Life Balance by Job Role:
        The pie chart indicates that Human Resources and Research Scientists have the highest work-life balance scores, both around 11.64% and 11.4%, respectively.
        Other roles like Sales Representatives (11.51%), Managers (11.05%), and Manufacturing Directors (11.01%) also show significant balance.

    Overtime Work Distribution:
        A significant proportion of employees do not work overtime, with females showing a higher percentage of no overtime compared to males.
        Employees who do work overtime are predominantly male.

    Job Involvement by Department:
        The bar chart shows that job involvement is fairly balanced across genders within the departments of Human Resources, Research & Development, and Sales.
        Research & Development exhibits the highest average job involvement, followed by Sales and Human Resources.

    Relationship Satisfaction and Monthly Income:
        Employees in the Research & Development department have the highest average relationship satisfaction and monthly income.
        The Sales department follows, with Human Resources having the lowest scores in both metrics.

    Employee Attrition:
        The overall attrition rate is 16.1%.
        Filtering by gender, it appears that both males and females contribute to this attrition rate, with no significant gender disparity.
        By department, attrition seems evenly distributed among Human Resources, Research & Development, and Sales.

Recommendations

    Improvement in Work-Life Balance:
        Despite a reasonable average work-life balance, there is room for improvement. Departments with lower scores should adopt best practices from those with higher scores, such as Human Resources and Research & Development.

    Addressing Overtime Work:
        The company should look into the reasons behind higher male overtime work and explore ways to mitigate excessive overtime, ensuring better work-life balance for all employees.

    Enhancing Job Involvement:
        Strategies to boost job involvement, especially in departments with lower scores, can be implemented. This may include team-building activities, recognition programs, and career development opportunities.

    Increasing Relationship Satisfaction:
        Efforts should be made to enhance relationship satisfaction across all departments, particularly focusing on Human Resources, which has the lowest score. This could involve regular feedback sessions, conflict resolution mechanisms, and fostering a supportive work environment.

    Reducing Attrition Rates:
        To address the 16.1% attrition rate, it's crucial to understand the underlying causes. Exit interviews, employee surveys, and focus groups can provide insights. Tailored retention strategies should be developed for each department.

Conclusion

The dashboard provides valuable insights into employee work-life balance and engagement. By focusing on the areas highlighted and implementing the recommendations, the organization can enhance overall employee satisfaction, reduce attrition, and foster a more engaged and productive workforce.
